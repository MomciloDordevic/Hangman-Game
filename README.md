Welcome to my Hangman Game project!

The Hangman Game is a project I have build using HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JavaScript.


It is a simple game where the goal is to guess one of the 20 different pre defined words.
Each player is presented with a keyboard that consists of each letter in the alphabet, upon selecting a letter the function checks if the selected letter
exsists in the word array.
If the selected letter does exsist, it is presented/revealed in the final solution.
If the selected letter does not exsist, an image is shown coresponding to the amount of wrong answeres issued.
Images depict how many attempts does the player have remaining.
The player has a total of 6 attempts before the game is over and the user is promped to restart and try again.
The user is informed of the result of the game when the game comes to a end either by wining or losing.


The goal of this project was to practise vanilla JavaScript and make a simple app with it.

Bootstrap was used in the project in order to cut down on time invested into dealing with styles, positioning, and making the application responsive.
